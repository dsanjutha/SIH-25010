## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The Smart Crop Advisory System will provide farmers with personalized crop, soil, and weather-based recommendations using AI and remote sensing.
It will offer timely advice on irrigation, fertilizers, pest/disease control, and market prices through a multilingual app with voice/SMS support.
Real-time alerts and low-cost solutions will help small and marginal farmers improve yield, reduce risks, and increase income sustainably.

## Technical Approach
The system integrates AI/ML models with soil data, weather forecasts, and satellite imagery to generate personalized crop advisories.
A cloud-based backend processes farmer profiles and field data, delivering insights via mobile app, SMS, or voice in local languages.
IoT sensors and remote sensing enhance accuracy for soil moisture, pest detection, and irrigation scheduling.
APIs for market prices and weather ensure real-time updates, while feedback loops continuously improve recommendations.

## Feasibility and Viability
The solution is feasible using existing AI, IoT, and mobile technologies with low-cost deployment for small farmers.
Its multilingual and offline support ensures accessibility even in rural areas with limited connectivity.
Partnerships with government agencies and FPOs make the system scalable, sustainable, and economically viable.

## Impact and Benefits
The system will empower small and marginal farmers with data-driven decisions to improve crop yield and quality.
Timely advisories on weather, pests, and irrigation will reduce losses and input costs.
Market linkage support will enhance farmers’ income and profitability.
Overall, it promotes sustainable farming, better resource use, and improved livelihoods.

## Research and References
The solution is inspired by studies on ICT in agriculture (FAO, World Bank reports) and existing models like Kisan Call Centers, eNAM, and AgriStack.
Research papers on AI-based crop prediction, remote sensing for soil and pest detection, and IoT-driven smart farming provide technical grounding.
References include publications from ICAR, Ministry of Agriculture (India), FAO, and open-source datasets such as Sentinel/Landsat satellite data and IMD weather APIs.
